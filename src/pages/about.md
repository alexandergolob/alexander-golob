    We make create art for community. 


    Golob Art has worked on community-led art projects since 2013, and, since
    2017, it has worked in partnership with multiple communities in- and outside
    of Massachusetts. These partnerships have resulted projects deeply involved
    in equity work. The pieces are created with extensive community engagement,
    from the technique and theme, to the designs. 


    Most recently, the studio completed a mural in Haverhill titled Miles to Go
    Before We Sleep. It was comprised of 46 brightly-painted panels, each with
    the image of a community member based of images submitted by their family
    members and friends, surrounded by an abstract iteration of the Haverhill
    skyline. This mural praises and shines a light on Haverhill’s varied
    immigrant and minority community members and families.  


    As is evident in these examples, Golob Art's mission is to continue to
    produce projects to address inequities in our communities.

      Alexander Golob was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts to a bilingual,
      Italian and Jewish-American household. He then spent his teenage years in
      Wellesley, MA, after which he studied art in both Boston and Venice,
      Italy. 


      With his studio, Golob Art, it is Alexander’s mission to create engaging
      art that expands beyond the walls of a gallery to provoke thought in the
      public, lifts up viewers, and transforms physical space. Alexander Golob
      has experience engaging with communities, conducting research, and
      developing and implementing art and placemaking policy, strategy, and
      integration. His studio has worked with city governments on policy and
      implementation, non-profits embarking upon art initiatives, and
      early-stage start-ups looking for guidance. Golob Art has opened a 2,500
      sq. ft art show in Boston, has held an interactive snapchat art
      installation at the Peabody Essex Museum, and worked with the City of
      Methuen on a public art initiative.


      Alexander loves everything about food. Learning its historical origins,
      making it, sharing it with others, and its power to build bridges among
      all people.
