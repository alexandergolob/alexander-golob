Nestled between Nordstrom Rack and Target, University Station has gained a piece of public artwork: Alexander Golob's "Diverging Paths." Golob reports that he created this mural after University Station's property managers approached him to design a piece of public art for this location. His body of work includes public art in Somerville, Wellesley, and Haverhill.

"I was inspired by how University Station is a nexus of travel," says Golob. "\[University Station] is a crossroads for train and car travel, and has added commercial and residential spaces in recent years. I wanted to show what University Station has come to represent."

"Diverging Paths" has a large center circle with train tracks in its center. Golob explains that the train tracks can either be viewed as them merging or them splitting apart. "Each corner panel in 'Diverging Paths' has a vista of place where the train system can take you, including Boston, New York City, and Hartford. I used a technique that lets each corner panel able to be changed in the future with the changing energy of University Station."
