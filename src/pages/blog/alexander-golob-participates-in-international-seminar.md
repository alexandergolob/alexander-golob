**BOSTON, Ma. (Oct. 14, 2016)** -- Golob Art partnered with the national organization, [Represent.Us](https://represent.us/), to facilitate an educational discussion and workshop for a group of Dutch university students studying in the United States Friday, October 14, 2016. 

According to the [official website](https://represent.us/), Represent.Us is “the nation’s largest grassroots anti-corruption campaign, \[which brings] together conservatives, progressives, and everyone in between to pass powerful anti-corruption laws that stop political bribery, end secret money, and give voters a stronger voice.” Cristian Morales, head of the [Boston chapter](http://volunteer.represent.us/boston) of Represent.Us invited Alexander to serve as a guest speaker for the evening.

The students, representing a wide variety of educational backgrounds - from theater, to political science, to biology - have been on a ‘research trip’ to the United States with the intentions of studying the complementary nature between science and art, as well as whether this relationship plays a role in social change.

As a guest speaker, resident artist Alexander Golob spoke with the international students about art and activism - specifically how context affects social action and how visual symbology can be used to manifest change. Alexander also examined the [Occupy Movement ](http://occupywallst.org/)and [Black Lives Matter](http://blacklivesmatter.com/) as international and national movements which use art and creativity to initiate mass social change.

“As an artist, it’s important to be able to know why you create the art that you do,” Alexander said. “It’s an amazing thing to be able to use the creative process to spark real, tangible social change.”
