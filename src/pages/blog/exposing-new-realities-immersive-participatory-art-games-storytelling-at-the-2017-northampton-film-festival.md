_(September 21st, 2017, Northampton, Mass.)_ The Northampton Film Festival will launch its second year of curated immersive content showcasing games, experiences and stories in VR, AR, 360, social media and participatory art-making at the A.P.E  Gallery at 126 Main Street, Northampton, MA on **Saturday, September 30th, 2017, from 12-5pm.**

This event is free and open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis.
