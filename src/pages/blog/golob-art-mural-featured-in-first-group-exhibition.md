**SOMERVILLE, Ma. (Oct. 2, 2016)** -- Golob Art showcased one of its signature community murals, Kaleidoscope, in the Wall to Wall: Art Builds Communities gallery exhibition Saturday, October 2, in Somerville, Massachusetts.

W2W, held from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Nave Gallery on Powder House Boulevard, featured the exhibition itself as well as artist panels and presentations in the spirit of initiating positive dialogue and laying groundwork for fundamentally equal artist practice.

The gallery will showcased dozens of street artists, highlighting the ways in which their pieces unite communities and inspire creativity and involvement.

Alexanderâ€™s mural, Kaleidoscope, is located at Commonwealth Avenue and depicts recognizable landmarks and buildings along the road. It has sparked a wealth of community involvement, being used as a backdrop for a music video, for advertising purposes and as a site for various public events at Boston University. The mural has even been adopted as a local PokeStop.

W2W featured large-scale photos of community members involving Kaleidoscope in events or publications.
