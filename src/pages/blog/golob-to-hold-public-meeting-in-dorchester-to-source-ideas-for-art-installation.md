**Dorchester, MA. (August 7, 2017)**  Local artist, Alexander Golob will be facilitating a public meeting on Wednesday, August 9 at 7:00 p.m at Elmhurst Park in Dorchester in order to investigate what themes, styles, and subjects the community wants to see in the artist’s upcoming installation. The light installation will be on view for one year in the windows of an abandoned warehouse at 18 New England Avenue. 

The placemaking project, funded by grants from both the Boston Society of Architects Foundation, and the Greater Boston Association of Realtors, is focused on engaging residents from the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle Eco Innovation District (TNT EID), Boston’s first Eco-District, and calls attention to Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation’s (CSNDC) focus on affordable, eco-friendly, Transit-Oriented Development.  CSNDC is building a better, stronger Codman Square and Dorchester through the development of safe, sustainable, and affordable residential and commercial spaces, and by promoting ﬁnancial and economic stability for residents of the neighborhood. CSNDC and Golob invite the community stop by and give their input to the artist on Wednesday.

The meeting will take place concurrently with Talbot-Norfolk Triangle Neighbors United Family Fun Night, a free family event that takes place from 7:00 PM-8:30 PM, at Elmhurst Park, Elmhurst St., Dorchester, MA.
