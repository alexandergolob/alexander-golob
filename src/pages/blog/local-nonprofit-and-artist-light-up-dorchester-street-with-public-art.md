**Dorchester, MA. (Januray 22, 2018)** Local artist, Alexander Golob and the non-profit Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation (CSNDC) are proud to unveil a new work of public light-art, Shining Strong, Shining Bright, along New England Avenue in Dorchester. This bright and dynamic silhouette public light-art installation has five panels that fill the windows of the vacated industrial building at 18 New England Avenue. It will be on view until summer, 2018.

At a time when the equity-related impacts of climate change are on the minds of all Americans, the art focuses on the increasingly important themes of cherishing nature and celebrating the diverse community that lives around Codman Square. Each panel features these themes at a different scale – the smallest being a leaf and the largest being traditional triple-decker houses. The panels were created with extensive community engagement – everything from the technique and theme, to the designs, was chosen and created with community input. ​

The placemaking project, supported by grants from the Boston Society of Architects Foundation and the Greater Boston Association of Realtors, as well as by a donation of materials from Sewphisticated, is focused on engaging residents from the Talbot-Norfolk Triangle Eco-Innovation District (TNT EID), Boston’s first Eco-District, and calls attention to CSNDC’s focus on affordable, eco-friendly, Transit-Oriented Development.  CSNDC is building a better, stronger Codman Square and Dorchester through the development of safe, sustainable, and affordable residential and commercial spaces, and by promoting ﬁnancial and economic stability for residents of the neighborhood. CSNDC and Golob invite the community stop by and enjoy the new artwork.
