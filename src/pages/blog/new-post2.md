As the sun rose on the second day of Wellesley’s Wonderful Weekend on Sunday, May 19, there was a new addition to the roadway on Central Street. But just barely, as it took Alexander Golob until after 3 a.m. to finish painting the blue and yellow “Boston Strong” and “Wellesley Strong” mottos at the halfway point of the Boston Marathon course.

“It was a long night,” the Boston University sophomore and Wellesley resident said. “I’m thankful that I was even contacted.”

Carl Nelson, a member of the Wellesley Celebrations Committee that organizes the weekend, contacted Golob with an idea of how to commemorate last month’s Boston Marathon bombings.

“It’s the largest town gathering,” Nelson said of the parade that preceded the dedication of the halfway markers. “I thought it would be quite appropriate.”
