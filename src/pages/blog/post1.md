For a while, I have wanted to start a publication to address the art world’s new aspects, and follow it as it changes and evolves. So… we are starting a blog! And it will live here. I hope this blog will evolve over time, but I hope to start by featuring artists local to the city of Boston, recent articles I find compelling that discuss the art world, and hope to paint an updated and complete picture of the experience of being an artist in today’s world. 



Stay tuned for that drop, coming later this month, and [SUBSCRIBE HERE](https://alexander-golob.netlify.com/subscribe)!
