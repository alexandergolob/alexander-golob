Boston residents walking up Beacon Street may notice a new burst of color among the storefronts in Kenmore Square.

Alexander Golob, who graduated from the College of Fine Arts in 2016, is the director of the new Post-Cubicle Gallery, an art space that he opened on property owned by Hotel Buckminster.

Together with co-curators Edie Côté and Danielle Pratt, who both graduated from CFA last year, Golob hosted the gallery’s opening on Friday with its inaugural show “Tales from the Gut.” The show focuses on stories of nostalgia, trauma and personal emotion.

“We wanted to make something with stories that people will gain something from seeing, or that people will find connection with,” Golob said. “The goal is that people \[will] be moved or provoked or changed for the better.”

Thirty artists are featured in the exhibition, including Golob, Côté and Pratt themselves. The medium of art varies widely, ranging from oil paintings to etchings to plaster-and-foam-sculptures to video projects. Each piece relates to the theme of “tales from the gut.”
