Alexander Golob

Hailing from Wellesley, MA and majoring in painting and political science, Alexander Golob (CFA/CAS’16) isn’t satisfied with the status quo. When he joined the College of Fine Arts Student Government as a freshman, it had four members and a vaguely worded constitution that confused CFA with CAS. Now, CFA Gov has 11 positions and a significantly more specific goal—as Golob articulately puts it, “to be an advocate and resource for student concerns and initiatives; build community between the students, alumni, faculty, and staff; and spread the arts throughout BU and the Greater Boston area.”

As president of CFA Gov this academic year, Golob initiated several events to accomplish just that. His government coordinated seasonal sales for CFA students to sell their art, involving the CFA Alumni Association. He took the lead to organize a new program that allows CFA students to teach inexpensive, 90-minute art classes to anyone in the community. Aided by the BU Arts Initiative, on whose student advisory board Golob serves, he collaborated with BU Hip-Hop to instigate the first BU Hip-Hop and CFA Gov Street Art Immersion event. Held on the COM Lawn on April 4, the four-hour exhibition gave passersby the opportunity to observe and try their hands at spray-painted street art.
