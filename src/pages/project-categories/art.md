      It is our studio’s opinion that people need creativity and art. Having art
      built into the fabric of the space where they live, work, and play results
      in stronger recognition and uniqueness in crowded markets, increased
      social and economic activity, higher retention of tenants, and happier
      community members. Golob Art offers the unique artist’s touch to
      developing character and uniqueness in a community and space.

      Along with helping to form organizations, Golob Art has deep experience
      with engaging and organizing communities. This includes respectfully
      listening to, learning from, and partnering with local community members
      and leaders, fundraising and identifying sponsors for critical arts
      projects, organizing community round-tables, planning arts events, and
      developing longer term arts initiatives. Because Golob Art deeply believes
      in the value of this type of engagement in the public art process, this
      service is a critical component to many of the studio’s art projects.
