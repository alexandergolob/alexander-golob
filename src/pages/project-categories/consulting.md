  Art provides benefits for sense of community, business, marketing, and health.
  Sometimes, it helps to have an artist to integrate that perspective into a
  community, business, or project. Our studio has worked with city governments
  on policy and implementation, non-profits embarking upon art initiatives, and
  early stage start-ups looking for guidance.

      Public art and creative placemaking has a unique capacity to transform a
      community for the better - from engaging communities, conducting research
      and grant-writing, developing and implementing art and placemaking policy,
      and creating artworks.


      We merge our experience in community engagement and problem solving with
      our expertise in the Arts to confidently and effectively foster the Arts
      in your community or organization.
