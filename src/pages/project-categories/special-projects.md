      Located in Boston's busy Kenmore Square, in collaboration with Hotel
      Buckminster, Post-Cubicle Gallery is a space organized by local artists
      Alexander Golob, Edie Côté and Danielle Pratt. Formerly an abandoned cat
      hospital, Post-Cubicle Gallery has transformed over 2000 sq feet into a
      welcoming place for all artists and visitors alike to express themselves.

      This multi-artist show, held Friday, May 19th, 2017, featured works that
      create a surreal, dissonance-inducing, and awe-inspiring space that focus
      on the Wellesley community and its context in society. The show takes
      inspiration from Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces to
      organize itself in a manner that evokes a journey of self-realization.

      Since its onset, Venice has always occupied a unique position - in
      history, in commerce, and in culture. Caught on the edges of many worlds,
      Venice has always taken bits and pieces of other civilizations to create
      and cultivate its own unique identity.


      This installation aims to confuse, to blur, and to elaborate upon Venice’s
      many -  sometimes - conflicting identities.  As both a citizen of the
      United States and Veneto, Italy, I feel myself caught distinctly between
      these identities, confronting Venice as both a visitor and a citizen. My
      work draws on the Venetian tradition of creating an immediate visual
      effect while also establishing several overlapping and sometimes
      contradicting meanings.

      A new community-driven project at the intersection of art, food, and
      identity




      Around the Table explores the intersection of food, art, and identity by
      creating a installations that embody the culinary diaspora and by hosting
      a series of community events in collaboration with local chefs to engage
      people with intertwining stories and cuisines. The installation will
      include custom-created tableware with community-gathered stories etched
      into the table and chairs. Around the Table will serve as a space to build
      community, elevate marginalized experiences, and enjoy good food.
