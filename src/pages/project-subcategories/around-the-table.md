_Around the Table_ explores the intersection of food, art, and identity by creating a installations that embody the culinary diaspora and by hosting a series of community events in collaboration with local chefs to engage people with intertwining stories and cuisines. The installation will include custom-created tableware with community-gathered stories etched into the table and chairs. _Around the Table_ will serve as a space to build community, elevate marginalized experiences, and enjoy good food.
