Art provides benefits for sense of community, business, marketing, and health. Sometimes, it helps to have an artist to integrate that perspective into a community, business, or project. The studio has worked with city governments on policy and implementation, non-profits embarking upon art initiative, and early stage start-ups looking for guidance.
