At Golob Art, we have a passion for public art and creative placemaking - from creating custom artwork and arts events to community engagement and integration of creative placemaking into architectural plans.

Over the past four years, we have worked on a number of exciting projects. These include: masterplanning the creative placemaking for large developments, create engaging and beautiful public artworks and murals, engage with over a hundred individual community stakeholders for a Greater Boston development project, and transform vacant and dilapidated spaces into vibrant community spaces with regular programming with over 200 people in attendance.

Notable clients include:

Federal Realty Investment Trust; Hotel Buckminster; The Michaels Organization; and Lupoli Companies.
