      Located in a zen garden, this mural’s abstract composition draws its
      inspiration from the raking of pebbles in traditional Japanese gardens.
      Recreated photographs of community events at the nonprofit are painted
      within various monochrome sections.

      The work attempts to create an immediately visually intriguing space that
      is meditative and uplifting. As a work of art incorporated into SMOC’s
      meditative zen garden, the mural’s imagery takes inspiration from zen
      gardens and the raking of pebbles across the surface to resemble the flow
      and movement of water. The palette takes inspiration from the natural
      environment’s muted and rich palette. The alternation of muted reds,
      yellows, greens, and blues is inspired from the balance of seasons. Within
      these ripples of color, there are a number of painted scenes from the SMOC
      community drawn from photos. These images range from inaugurations of new
      buildings and community dinners to photographs of proud staff members and
      volunteers.
