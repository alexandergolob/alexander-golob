      This mural explores a line-based style and was completed for an opening
      restaurant, PokeCity. Drawing inspiration from both my technique
      exploration in [Blue Lines
      2](https://alexander-golob.netlify.com/projects/blue-lines-2), as well as
      the Hawaii coast line, my aim was to create a 2-dimensional image that
      subtly references the tropical, vacation experience, being minimalist and
      ambiguous enough to not be immediately recognized as the Hawaiian
      coastline, while also evoking a somewhat surreal 3-dimensional beach
      vacation feel.
