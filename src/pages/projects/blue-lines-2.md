      In this triptych, I ventured to explore new ways of creating images that
      are simultaneously 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional. This technique draws
      from internet vector imaging, meant to evoke ambiguous and somewhat
      surreal experiences. In this particular piece, I decided to be monochrome
      and only use blue as my line color.
