      From October 1st to 3rd, we created a mural series for HUB Week’s 2019
      Fall Festival! Both were about a green energy future (or present! We need
      it!). ⠀


      The series, _Green Path, Blue Skies_, was comprised of two murals, one,
      completed before the festival, the other I painted live! ⠀


      We wanted to extend a big Thank You to @HUBWeek organizers for having us
      at the event! ⠀
