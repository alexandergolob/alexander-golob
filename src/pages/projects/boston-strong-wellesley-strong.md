      This mural can be found painted in the middle of Center Street, the main
      street of the Town of Wellesley, at the half-way point of the Boston
      Marathon. Carl Nelson, a member of the Wellesley Celebrations Committee,
      contacted Golob Art with the idea of how to commemorate the Boston
      Marathon bombing. The halfway point is one of the three most significant
      points along the route, along with the starting line and finish line. It
      might be the most encouraging spot for runners.


      The eastbound side of the street features the words “Wellesley” and
      “Strong” on either side of the line in yellow paint. On the westbound
      side, the words, “Boston” and “Strong” appear in similar fashion and are
      accompanied by the blue and yellow ribbon that became the symbol of the
      terrorist attack in the days and weeks that followed.


      The piece is now a permanent fixture on Central Street, thanks in no small
      part to the five gallons of paint that were donated by the Franklin Paint
      Company, which provides all of Wellesley’s road paint. 


      I appreciate the opportunity to create a lasting impact on the town. It
      honors the citizens who create the community.
