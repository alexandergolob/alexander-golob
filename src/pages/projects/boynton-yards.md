      Mural completed for DLJ Real Estate at Boynton Yards, and features their
      logo, complete with a bouncy line covering the whole mural. 


      This mural was completed during the social distancing period of the
      COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Of course, all painting was done by only
      Alexander, completely alone, complying with social distancing regulations,
      and wearing masks and gloves.
