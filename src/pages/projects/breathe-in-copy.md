      _Breathe In – Copy_ takes a long look at short span of time and the
      strange particularities that arise in the final product when translating
      reality from one medium to another. Artist Alexander Golob deconstructs
      and reassembles Zachary McHale’s short gif of McHale breathing in and out
      and turns by turning each frame into a blue line painting and then
      reassembling them into their own gif. The two gifs were displayed side by
      side in the center of a length-wise arrangement of the paintings that make
      up the new gif.




      _Breathe In - Copy_ was part of the Through the Looking Glass Art Show--
