      Over the course of multiple engagements over two years, Alexander and his
      studio helped to revitalize a tempered arts community in the 50,000 person
      city of Methuen in the Merrimack Valley of north-eastern Massachusetts.

      In the first engagement, the studio conducted a great deal of community
      outreach and engagement and research to develop a comprehensive 52-page
      report on the city's downtown with associated recommendations and
      resources. This document was published by the mayor's office and has acted
      as a guide for future actions for the city ever since.

      The second and third engagements focused on implementing some of the
      recommendations contained within the downtown public art report. The
      second engagement planted seeds of community engagement to eventually
      nurture self-sustaining arts organization. This work took place during the
      Winter and Spring of 2018. By the end of this period, two clear groups had
      formed, the Methuen Arts Partnership and Methuen Day. Since the period of
      engagement, both of these organizations have flourished: creating public
      art installations in the downtown and nearby rail-trail; and hosting a new
      annual Fall city fair that has already attracted over a thousand visitors
      and is poised to grow.               


      The third engagement explored, in partnership with IndusPAD, the developer
      of a major former factory space, the creation of a self-sustaining artist
      residency program. The project attracted 14 artists from across
      Northeastern Massachusetts. Now, a vacant factory space is a hub for
      artists who host events both within the building and in city center. In
      the five months since its inception, the residency program has created
      permanent works of public art, and developed a series of performances and
      events.
