      Our studio collaborated with The Michael's Organization, architects,
      landscape architects, and several government and community stakeholders to
      research, develop, and execute a comprehensive master plan for public art
      and creative placemaking for the Cobalt development in Allston,
      Massachusetts.                                    


      Cobalt is a modern mixed-use development in a formerly light industrial
      area of Allston known, in both the past and present, for its alt-music and
      D.I.Y. scene. The project includes 265 rental units - with eight units
      reserved for artists - 3,000 square feet of ground floor retail and 2,500
      square feet of ground floor arts space. For this arts space, our studio
      has provided critical expertise for site specifications, layout,
      programming, and determining the best management of the space. The
      execution of this plan also includes public artwork created by Golob Art
      along with additional sourcing from other artists and designers.
