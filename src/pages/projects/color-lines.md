      In this _Blue Lines 2_, I ventured to explore new ways of creating images
      that are simultaneously 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional. This technique
      draws from internet vector imaging, meant to evoke ambiguous and somewhat
      surreal experiences. In this particular piece, I decided to be do a
      colorful rendition. 


      _Color lines_ is a piece that examines my experiences through a series of
      9 images. at A's experience through various lenses.
