      While it’s not made of glass, the paneled mural _Coloring Book_ does
      employ an almost translucent effect contributing to its stained glass
      appearance. I really wanted people to be able to see the brushstrokes and
      have the white of the panel kind of show through.


      The 600 foot-long mural came about through a partnership with Federal
      Realty, which owns the property. Because the mural is so large, the
      unveiling was a special moment in that it allowed me to see my finished
      work come together at last -- I had never seen more than six panels
      together at any one point. So for me, it was really exciting when we were
      installing it because it was the first time that I was actually able to
      see it all together.


      It’s kind of an abstracted view of a lot of iconic images and places in
      Wellesley, a lot of it also mixed with nature. So there’s the Town Hall,
      there’s the library in the center and then there’s kind of three
      prototypical buildings that you might find in Wellesley — old wood-frame
      houses as well as some of the early 20th century brick stuff that you
      might find along Central Street and Washington Street. And then in the
      foreground you see kind of the commuter rail and the T station, as well as
      some people having a picnic.
