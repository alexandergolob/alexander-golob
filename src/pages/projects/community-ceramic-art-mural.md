      Site Visits and Preparation: Visit site to determine measurements,
      appropriate methods of construction, and possible complications. 


      Preparatory Planning: Determine appropriate steps to make artwork a
      reality. Write content and prepare documents to aid in approval of
      artwork.




      Student Engagement


      Presentation: Develop and present a talk about my career and practice as
      an artist and WMS alumni. Present to WMS art classes.


      Work with Students: Will work with students in classroom in January and
      February to provide instruction, support, and feedback on their artwork
      and to answer questions about my personal and professional experience. 


      Work with Faculty: Will work with faculty to create faculty art tiles. 




      Artwork Creation and Installation


      Tile Creation and Firing: This will require careful preparation, cutting,
      firing, and glazing of 910 or 1,280 tiles. This portion will be assisted
      by the art staff.


      Artistic Design: Design the arrangement for 910 to 1,280 tile artworks
      totaling between 250 and 350 sq.ft in size. Will include back and forth
      between artist and WMS to modify design to both groupsâ€™ liking. 


      Mark and Prepare Tiles: Mark the tiles in an organized grid system (A-1,
      A-2 etc.) for proper layout and then wrap and box tiles for craftsperson
      to install.
