      **About the Project**


      Golob Art's lead artist, Alexander, worked with his old middle school art
      teachers to have all of Wellesley Middle School's 160-plus faculty and
      staff make tiles that went into a large art installation featuring over
      900 tiles. "What a humbling and incredible experience it is to be able to
      use what I have learned to contribute to my middle school." - Alexander


      Alexander was artist in residence for it, gave artist talk to 900
      middle-schoolers in groups of 40-50 at a time, and organized and led 100+
      person ceramic activity with teachers and staff, in addition to helping to
      create the art itself.


      **Roles and Responsibilities of the Artist-in-Residence**


      In preparation, he visited the site to determine measurements, appropriate
      methods of construction, and possible complications. He determined the 
      appropriate steps to make artwork a reality, wrote content and prepared
      documents to aid in the approval of the artwork.


      **Student Engagement**


      Alexander developed and presented a talk about his career and practice as
      an artist and WMS alumni to the middle school art classes.


      In developing the artwork, he worked with students in their classrooms
      throughout January and February to provide instruction, support, and
      feedback on their artwork and to answer questions about his personal and
      professional experience. 


      He also worked with the faculty to create their art tiles. 


      **Artwork Creation and Installation**


      The tiles for the project were created and required firing in a kiln. This
      process  required careful preparation, cutting, firing, and glazing of
      over 900 tiles. This portion was possible thanks to the assistance of the
      WMS art staff.


      Artistic Design: 


      The arrangement for the tile artworks totaled around 3,200 sq.ft, and was
      created with feedback from WMS to modify design to both partiesâ€™ liking. 


      He marked the tiles in an organized grid system (A-1, A-2 etc.) for proper
      layout, and then wrapped and boxed tiles for a craftsperson to install.
