      Participatory art-making where community members can create their own 3D
      in VR and in social media-inspired murals composed of hundreds of
      individual Snapchats, #theSnapGallery. By adding art to their compositions
      to the snaps with markers, visitors will bridge image-making techniques
      and traditions with digital age content creation. This interactive project
      demonstrates how everyone can be an artist and/or an activist, especially
      when combining voices into something larger than a single person, like a
      community art installation.
