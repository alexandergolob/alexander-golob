      We did three mural projects for NEEP, focused on their core aspects:
      supporting dynamic systems, getting us off fossil fuels, spreading best
      practices, and connecting communities â€“ with an emphasis on the Northeast
      and Mid-Atlantic regions that NEEP serves. The work will be installed on
      three walls. Each wall will have a slightly different concept. The NEEP
      logo and name will most likely be featured in adhesive vinyl while the art
      component will probably be painted directly on the wall.

      Grey Wall: The entry way to NEEP. It should say what NEEP is all about and
      what regions it serves. Possibly including text and logo using adhesive
      vinyl and laser-cut wood.




      Yellow Wall: The visualization of what NEEP is all about: energy and
      material efficiency. This wall will likely involve imagery connecting
      nature and machinery. It will probably be created on plywood panels that
      will be affixed to the wall. When/if NEEP moves office spaces, this work
      will be able to move with the organization.

      Blue Wall: The visualization of the future that NEEP envisions: one where
      our society use 100 percent sustainable and green energy and material
      practices. This piece will likely showcase a architectural structures
      along with other images.
