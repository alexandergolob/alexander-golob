      Prospect Cities with business and community leaders from across the
      country. Hosted by now State Representative, Andy Vargas, the roundtable

      communities in mid-sized post-industrial cities. It was attended by Mayors
      and other officials from communities in places as far south as North
      Carolina, as far West as Ohio, and as far North as Quebec.
