      I featured a photo-backdrop frame inspired by that mural. Haverhill
      Multicultural Gala served as a fundraising event for the Haverhill
      Multicultural Festival, to occur for the first time on July 20, 2020.* The
      festival is one of the many spinoff projects to come out of our immigrant
      and origin story mural, [_Miles to Go Before We
      Sleep_](https://alexandergolobart.com/projects/miles-to-go-before-we-sleep)_._
