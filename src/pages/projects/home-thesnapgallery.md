      \#theSnapGallery is an innovative public artwork that relies heavily on
      viewer interaction. It is composed of two elements: snapchats taken on my
      cell phone placed behind glass and participants who add to or trace
      aspects of the snapchats with markers. After this, my original snapchat is
      removed, leaving behind a collaboratively-created image emblematic of a
      productive community. #TheSnapGallery is adaptable and can be executed as
      a pop-up event or in a more organized environment.

      \#theSnapGallery is an artistic investigation into the growing influence
      of the internet and social media on how we form interpersonal
      relationships, express ourselves, and form communities.


      Most recently, the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA invited
      #theSnapgallery to their Historic House Crush Block Party. A HUGE thanks
      to everyone involvedâ€“ especially those who submitted snaps, traced a
      composition on the work, or simply enjoyed the feeling of community I hope
      it evokes!
