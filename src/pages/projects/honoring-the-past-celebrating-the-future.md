      The mural represents the integration of immigrants from the Caribbean into
      the Greater Boston Community!


      I combined artistic efforts with Haitian tin artists to create _Honoring
      the Past, Celebrating the Future_, a mixed media mural at the South
      Middlesex Opportunity Council. This piece demonstrates the power of
      collaboration through its very execution: 


      > Together we are able to achieve what we never could alone.


      Haitian tin artists of the Cite Soleil Opportunity Council created 25
      pieces for the mural.
