      The Immigrant and Origin Story Mural Project is a multifaceted mural and
      creative placemaking project celebrating the tapestry of local immigrant
      and origin stories in neighborhoods across this country. The project
      centers on a public mural along with a host of related events that
      activate the space - engaging the community at every step of the process. 


      _This project aims to address three aspects of a community: 1.
      beautification of an area with a powerful, stunning artwork that offers a
      sense of identity; 2. elevation of underrepresented immigrant and origin
      stories and the strengthening of the entire area’s sense of community; 3.
      stimulation of economic activity and self-initiated community
      initiatives._ 


      **Creative Placemaking**


      **Immigrant and Origin Stories**


      **Economic Development**


      _**\*why “and Origin?”**_ _to acknowledge the stories of 1. people who
      found themselves here against their free will and 2. indigenous peoples
      who have always called this land their home._

      **Pilot - Haverhill, MA**


      This project’s pilot was in Haverhill, MA, a post-industrial city of
      approximately 60,000 with rapidly changing demographics and growing pains
      related to those changes. Its residents come from a variety of backgrounds
      that arrived at different periods in history - with large Italian,
      English, French-Canadian, and Irish communities. Today, twenty percent of
      Haverhill identifies as Latino, having immigrated more recently. 


      The mural’s style was developed to both celebrate the cultural histories
      of long-time residents and elevate the current experiences of more recent
      immigrants.The mural was painted in a style inspired by Italian folk-art
      traditions that incorporated local history and showcased 46 brightly
      painted panels featuring 148 portraits of community members of diverse and
      time-periods. These portraits are framed by a border incorporating local
      iconography. In the mural’s center, there is a tableaux of the Haverhill
      city skyline incorporating community-identified landmarks. 


      Every step of this project was collaborative, engaging over 30 local and
      state nonprofits and businesses, along with several community leaders
      including legislators, business executives, and community activists. The
      project hosted youth storytelling workshops, interactive art projects,
      poetry performances, community listening sessions, potlucks, and a large
      story-gathering initiative.


      The mural and associated programming have had a long term impact,
      enlivening the area’s sense of community, creating a representative
      expression of the city, and bringing economic improvements by increasing
      activity in the downtown and encouraging additional investment.
