      Light alone is beautiful, but in Venice, it becomes magical. There is
      something about the misty atmosphere and ochre walled, winding pathways
      that creates a space for light to guide and amaze. Having returned to the
      United States from a five month stay in Venice, I wanted to create a work
      of art that evokes that same sense of magic that only a city like Venice
      can. My idea is to create an installation of at least 30 hanging wooden
      lanterns made from laser-cutting that emulate the surreal qualities of one
      of the most spectacular cities on earth.
