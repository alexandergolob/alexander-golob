      We managed the Italian Contemporary Art Gallery while the owner was in
      Italy on business trips. Over the 4 months that we managed it, we
      rearranged and hung art shows, and hosted three gallery shows, in addition
      to managing social media.

      _Venice on My Mind_ - featuring Alexander Golob 


      New and old, sacred and mundane, touristic and authentic, who belongs and
      who decides who belongs? Venice, a city with over a thousand years of
      history has a lot to say about these issues.⁠


      _Venice On My Mind_ is an art show and conversation about Italian art and
      culture among international artists. It featured varied art inspired by
      Venice, and other Italian cities.⁠


      Alexander's artwork, _Pala D'Altare_, was featured and made its American
      premier at the show!

      _Because Art Makes Happiness_ - Italian Contemporary Art Gallery artists


      This was the first gallery show of the winter season! _Because Art Makes
      Happiness_ focused on the interpretation of joy in its many artistic
      forms, and encouraged the viewer to find their own joy through the art. 


      This show was featured on the first floor of the gallery, while we
      featured local artists in the basement space. We had three opening events
      with this show, the first on its own on January 31st 2020, and the second
      in conjunction with Boston-area artists Shelby Feltoon and Cameron Boyce,
      and the third featuring local artist Emily Mogavero. *

      A fun, underground art show (Really! It's in a basement!) in partnership
      with our first show, "Because Art Makes Happiness", focusing on artistic
      interpretations of joy. This show includes works from Italian artists,
      exhibited on the main floor of the gallery, and features local Boston area

      _Self / Reflect_ - featuring local artist [Emily
      Mogavero](https://www.instagram.com/goodartwithfriends/) *


      Reflections present, distort, and collapse. They are tools for
      self-preservation, self-examination, and self-expression as well as for
      understanding the surrounding world. _Self / Reflect_ explores mirroring
      and reflecting through printmaking to collapse context and create an
      obscured portrait.⁠ 


      Featuring her work in the basement, this was the third solo show as part
      of the gallery-wide winter exhibition "Because Art Makes Happiness",
      focusing on artistic interpretations of joy.⁠




      \* This show had to be cancelled due to the COVD-19 pandemic outbreak and
      Massachusetts having to go into lockdown.
