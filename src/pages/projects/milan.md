      I was invited to give a lecture at the International University of
      Language and Communication in Milan, Italy, thanks to the amazing Culture
      and Business Professor, Annamaria Esposito. I talked about what public art
      can encompass, my path (so far!), and strategies and hurdles for making a
      creative idea come to fruition.
