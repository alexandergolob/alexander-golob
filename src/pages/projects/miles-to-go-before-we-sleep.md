      Miles to Go Before We Sleep is a multifaceted mural and creative
      placemaking project celebrating local immigrant and origin stories in the
      downtown of Haverhill, Massachusetts. It is comprised of 46
      brightly-painted panels each with the image of a community member based of
      images submitted by their family members and friends. These surrounded an
      abstract iteration of the Haverhill skyline. The mural was created with
      input from the local community at every step of the process, from
      conception to actualization.
