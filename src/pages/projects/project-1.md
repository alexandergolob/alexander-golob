      Golob Art’s mural, Kaleidoscope, is located at Commonwealth Avenue, on the
      parking lot wall of Boston University’s College of Fine Artsand depicts
      recognizable landmarks and buildings along the road. It has sparked a
      wealth of community involvement, being used as a backdrop for a music
      video, for advertising purposes and as a site for various public events at
      Boston University. The mural has even been adopted as a local PokeStop. It
      reflects back the surrounding street-scape in a stained-glass-inspired
      style emblematic of community— the coming together of many unique pieces
      into a cohesive unity. Since its completion, Kaleidoscope has been the
      site of various community functions and revitalized its immediate site.

      This project was funded by the College of Fine Arts at Boston University,
      to decorate their parking lot. As a public art piece, it required two
      phases - the public input for the design, and then the creation of the
      work.  The first, which was voted on by the Student Government, took place
      December 2016 through May 2017, and consisted of community meetings and
      developing a proposal for a work of art on Boston University’s Kenmore
      Classroom Building. The second phase of the project, the creation was
      completed in September of 2013.
