      \#theSnapGallery is an artistic investigation into the growing influence
      of the internet and social media on how we form interpersonal
      relationships, express ourselves, and form communities. #theSnapGallery is
      heavily reliant on community participation. It is composed of two
      elements: snapchats placed behind a glass sheet and drawings by
      participants who add to or trace aspects of the snaps with markers. After
      this step, the original snapchat is removed, leaving behind a
      collaboratively-created image emblematic of a productive community.
      #TheSnapGallery is adaptable and can be executed as a pop-up event or in a
      more organized environment.
