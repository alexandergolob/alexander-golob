      ## Abstract


      Since its onset, Venice has always occupied a unique position - in
      history, in commerce, and in culture. Caught on the edges of many worlds,
      Venice has always taken bits and pieces of other civilizations to create
      and cultivate its own unique identity.


      This installation aims to confuse, to blur, and to elaborate upon Venice’s
      many -  sometimes - conflicting identities.  As both a citizen of the
      United States and Veneto, Italy, I feel myself caught distinctly between
      these identities, confronting Venice as both a visitor and a citizen. My
      work draws on the Venetian tradition of creating an immediate visual
      effect while also establishing several overlapping and sometimes
      contradicting meanings. 


      The high altar draws inspiration from Venice’s rich religious and artistic
      history, the book The Insider’s Guide to Venezia seeks to capture the many
      ways that I perceive the city, and lastly a large set of pigeon sculptures
      pays homage to some of the most noticeable residents of contemporary
      Venice.

      ## Thesis


      Venice is a loaded city in terms of both cultural and symbolic
      significance. It seems to constantly vacillate between kitsch and
      authentic, pious and profane, welcoming and rejecting, and real and
      surreal. These are spaces that all cities must grapple with, but Venice
      provides a powerful case study in these dynamics.


      While many a tourist – and local – often lament about the lack of a “real
      Venice,” what defines contemporary Venice is still rooted in Venetian
      history and spirit. Since its onset, Venice – and the Venetian “Republic”
      has always had a mercantile, entrepreneurial, and show-offy attitude. A
      Venetian professor said it best when they likened Venice “for better or
      worse, to a pirate mentality.”


      These characteristics can be seen throughout the Serenissima’s history.
      Whether it is puffing up the story of St.Mark, opportunistically sacking
      Constantinople, accidentally becoming a maritime power, and then saving
      itself from the brink of destruction and finding economic strength in the
      production of culture and tourism up through the present day, Venice has
      kept its sense of self. Yet the same Venice can be seen in a different
      light; as a city that lives off of past glory and has abandoned its
      identity as a cultural and economic leader, a dying city, with sinking
      buildings and calli, and a dwindling number of residents, soon to only be
      inhabited by immigrants searching for service jobs, tourists looking to
      relive the past, students who only study in Venice to leave it upon
      graduating, and fashionable old ladies walking their dogs and carrying
      bags of supermarket discount produce.  What and who defines the city now?


      This installation draws upon my experience as a dual citizen of both the
      United States and Veneto, Italy as well as Venetian traditions to create
      an immediate aesthetic impact while conveying several overlapping and
      contradictory meanings that confuse, blur, and elaborate upon the multiple
      identities of the place. The installation has several perspectives and 
      focal points set within a space that mixes the mundane home and sacred
      church. These points include a High Altar, a book titled The Insider’s
      Guide to Venezia, and a series of pigeon sculptures. While each work
      stands on its own, together, they interact with and refer to each other as
      well as Venetian history and culture. This interweaving and layering
      allows the person experience the work to form a new reality created from
      their pre-conceived ideas of Venice confronted with the new real and
      surreal imagery and information provided. This work does not aim to preach
      a gospel truth, but rather to have viewers acknowledge their own
      preconceptions, to question them, and to grow from the experience.
