      The power of Story Corps, a nation-wide project to record people’s
      stories, and Humans of New York, a photo-journalism series showcasing
      people in their own words, speaks to the profound desire we have to be
      remembered and to assert our selfhood through recording. In both these
      cases, technology is invaluable to the process of asserting one’s very
      existence. However, these recordings needn’t be serious. In snapchat as in
      verbal communication, a simple gesture or utterance can be enough to
      express a full thought. Golobology makes use of these images for a
      two-pronged effect.

      The first is to show the images that I - in a very personal manner - use
      to shape my own sense of self. In the wild-eyed, hooded, and beaked
      Alexander, he is rearing his head back with text superimposed saying “SO
      PICCIONE. SO MUCH.” In this image, I connect to my last name, Golob, which
      means dove or pigeon, and my Italian home of Veneto, known for its city
      pigeons. Yet I also connect with my identity through a far less eccentric
      image of me and my brother sharing a fun selfie-moment coupled with
      affectionate “tuhuu, we classic. \*eye glasses\* \*cake\* \*target.\*”  In
      both moments, the images have been staged, picked, and edited to establish
      the image of who I am. The second portion of this imagery is to not only
      assert my identity, but to also create an open-ended conversation with the
      viewer. With only the images to decipher, the viewer is left to confront
      their own presumptions and judgements through a conversation with my
      imagery. ;)
