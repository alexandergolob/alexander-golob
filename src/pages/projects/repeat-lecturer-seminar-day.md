      Guest lecturer for multiple years at Wellesley Public High School's annual
      Seminar Day. Gave a 50 minute presentation, with 20 minutes included for
      Q&A, to highschoolers of all ages. The presentation was about the
      challenges I faced growing up and my choice to become an artist. I offered
      insight into the value of an arts education and the challenges and
      opportunities associated with it.
