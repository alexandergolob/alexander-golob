      **About the Project**


      _Shining Strong, Shining Bright_ is a public light art installation in
      Dorchester, MA. Pictured is one of four panels that I have made for the
      [Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation](csndc.com) in
      anticipation of a 13-block eco-friendly, transit-oriented, and affordable
      housing development. The artwork is a result of several conversations with
      the community, and hopes to lift up the themes and ideals that came out of
      those discussions. We hosted an official opening ceremony / event for the
      project.


      At a time when the equity-related impacts of climate change are on the
      minds of all Americans, the art focuses on the increasingly important
      themes of cherishing nature and celebrating the diverse community that
      lives around Codman Square. Each panel features these themes at a
      different scale – the smallest being a leaf and the largest being
      traditional triple-decker houses. The panels were created with extensive
      community engagement – everything from the technique and theme, to the
      designs, was chosen and created with community input.
