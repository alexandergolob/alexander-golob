      At a time when the equity-related impacts of climate change are on the
      minds of all Americans, the art focuses on the increasingly important
      themes of cherishing nature and celebrating the diverse community that
      lives around Codman Square. Each panel features these themes at a
      different scale – the smallest being a leaf and the largest being
      traditional triple-decker houses. The panels were created with extensive
      community engagement – everything from the technique and theme, to the
      designs, was chosen and created with community input.
