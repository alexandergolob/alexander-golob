      _Snapshot_ was derived from a collaboration between Golob Art and the
      members of Wellesley High Schoolâ€™s Diversity Club. The art itself places a
      series of small laser-etched screenshots of memes, texts, and social media
      conversations occurring among high school students during the 2016
      election period alongside a large and imposing photo-transfer of a photo
      of Trump winning the election. The result is a project that empowers
      youth, examines the role and language of social media, and takes an honest
      snapshot of political dynamics in the United States.


      Snapshot was part of the Through the Looking Glass Art Show-- [click
