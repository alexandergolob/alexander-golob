      Incorporate creative thought and transformative aesthetics into the
      development and build-out of the Heights project and the associated
      parking garage. The Arts are important â€“ both to the impact on the
      community and the bottom line. When it comes to community benefits, the
      Arts provide a unique opportunity to generate pride and project buy-in
      from both locals and officials, create a more beautiful and stimulating
      site, and establish Lupoli Companies as a leader in the sector. When it
      comes to business-fundamentals, the Arts offer prime opportunities for
      free advertising, improved lease-lock, and additional foot-traffic. 


      Golob Art provides overarching services for Lupoli Companies on the
      Heights project as a thought-partner and creator. This includes everything
      from assessing the site, working with relevant project participants and
      community members, and developing and implementing creative concepts for
      artworks, communal spaces, and way-finding.
