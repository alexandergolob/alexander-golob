      Worked with Lupoli Company, the City of Haverhill, architects, landscape
      architects, and several community stakeholders to research, develop, and
      execute a comprehensive master plan for public art and creative
      placemaking for the ten-story The Heights project in Haverhill, MA and the
      adjacent boardwalk and parking structure. The Heights is a modern, luxury
      mixed-use development in downtown Haverhill set along the Merrimack River.
      It will include Northern Essex Community College's Culinary Arts and
      Hospitality Center, outdoor terraces, a rooftop bar, and an activated
      public plaza and board walk. The execution of this plan includes creation
      by Golob Art of public artwork along with additional sourcing from other
      artists and designers.
