      The over 200 square-foot adhesive vinyl mural takes inspiration from
      plants found around Lake Waban and from 19th Century US folk art. The
      artwork creates lush, three-dimensional views of plants like rhododendron
      and pine, punctuated by moments of flat and punchy Americana-inspired
      nature and patterns. The work explores the mysteries of beauty, morality,
      nature, and how stories and myths help us to grapple with these concepts.
