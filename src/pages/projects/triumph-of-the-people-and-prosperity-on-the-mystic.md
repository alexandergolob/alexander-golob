      Triumph of the People and Prosperity on the Mystic combines shipping
      containers with mural art to create a colorful, eye-catching monument to
      the region’s history and to the hub of community and commerce that it has
      now become.


      Throughout the mural, nods to history can be found in the use of the
      ubiquitous Boston-area brick as the building block for the archway as well
      as the creeping collegiate ivy and the native-to-Massachusetts maiden hair
      fern along the sides of the structure. The centerpiece of the mural is the
      two-story tall stained-glass vista. Featuring the Mystic River, the always
      busy waterfront, and nearby buildings, the archway-framed centerpiece
      imagines a landscape full of color and energetic forms – one that reflects
      the activity that the area has now become. Standing tall at 25 feet with
      little behind or in front of the structure, the colorful archway turns an
      isolated lot into a bold and welcoming entry to a new neighborhood in the
      region.
