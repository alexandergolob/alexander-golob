      Light alone is beautiful, but in Venice, it becomes magical. There is
      something about the misty atmosphere and ochre walled, winding pathways
      that creates a space for light to guide and amaze. Having returned to the
      United States from a five month stay in Venice, I wanted to create a work
      of art that evokes that same sense of magic that only a city like Venice
      can. My idea is to create an installation of at least 30 hanging wooden
      lanterns made from laser-cutting that emulate the surreal qualities of one
      of the most spectacular cities on earth.

      ## The Designs


      Gondola Birdseye:


      The design below takes the motif of boats (or gondolla) seen from a
      birds-eye view. The abstraction depicts them laid out extending from a
      central, vertically oriented series of circles.

      Byzantine Gothic:


      The lantern at the left draws on Venice's Byzantine and Near East
      influences by making use of greek crosses and ogee curves.
