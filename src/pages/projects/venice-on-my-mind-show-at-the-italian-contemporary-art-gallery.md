      New and old, sacred and mundane, touristic and authentic, who belongs and
      who decides who belongs? Venice, a city with over a thousand years of
      history has a lot to say about these issues.⁠⁠


      Boston's [Italian Contemporary Art
      Gallery](http://www.italianvisualart.com/index_2.asp?l=EN) is hosted
      "Venice On My Mind," an art show and conversation about Italian art and
      culture among international artists. It featured varied art inspired by
      Venice, and other Italian cities.⁠


      My artwork, _Pala D'Altare_, was featured and made its American premier at
      the show!
