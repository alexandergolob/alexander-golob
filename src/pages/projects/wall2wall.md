      Golob Art showcased one of its signature community murals, Kaleidoscope,
      in the Wall to Wall: Art Builds Communities gallery exhibition Saturday,
      October 2, in Somerville, Massachusetts.


      W2W, held from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the Nave Gallery on Powder House
      Boulevard, featured the exhibition itself as well as artist panels and
      presentations in the spirit of initiating positive dialogue and laying
      groundwork for fundamentally equal artist practice.


      The gallery showcased dozens of street artists, highlighting the ways in
      which their pieces unite communities and inspire creativity and
      involvement.


      Alexander’s mural, Kaleidoscope, is located at Commonwealth Avenue and
      depicts recognizable landmarks and buildings along the road. It has
      sparked a wealth of community involvement, being used as a backdrop for a
      music video, for advertising purposes and as a site for various public
      events at Boston University. The mural has even been adopted as a local
      PokeStop.


      W2W featured large-scale photos of community members involving
      Kaleidoscope in events or publications.​
